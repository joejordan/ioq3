// hooks.h -- engine extensions: code a build links into the client or the
// dedicated server, such as a stats exporter, a metrics endpoint or a
// control socket for local tools, which the engine calls at fixed points.
//
// An extension defines one engineExtension_t, named <name>_extension, and
// its CMake file calls add_engine_extension( <name> ... )
// (cmake/utils/engine_extension.cmake), which links it in and lists it in
// the executable's engineExtensions table. Every hook may be NULL. With no
// extension linked, the table is empty and nothing here changes what the
// engine does.
//
// The hooks run on the main thread, from the frame loop, and must not
// block: an extension that does I/O polls it, within a budget of its own.
